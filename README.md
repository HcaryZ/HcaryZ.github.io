# BASKETBALL
Basketball is a team sport that involves two teams competing against each other on a rectangular court. Each team typically consists of five players. The main objective of the game is to shoot a basketball through the opponent's hoop, which is a basket mounted 10 feet high on a backboard at each end of the court. The basketball has a diameter of approximately 9.4 inches.

During the game, players aim to prevent the opposing team from scoring by defending their own hoop. A field goal, which is a successful shot, is worth two points, unless it is made from behind the three-point line, in which case it is worth three points. When a foul occurs, play is temporarily stopped, and the fouled player is given one, two, or three one-point free throws, depending on the situation.

The team with the highest number of points at the end of the game is declared the winner. However, if the score is tied at the end of regulation play, an additional period called overtime is played to determine the winner.

Players move the ball by either bouncing it while walking or running (known as dribbling) or by passing it to a teammate. Both of these techniques require skill. On offense, players can use various shooting techniques such as layups, jump shots, or dunks. On defense, they can steal the ball from an opponent, intercept passes, or block shots. Rebounding, which involves collecting a missed shot that bounces off the rim or backboard, can be done by either the offense or defense.

Certain actions are considered violations in basketball. These include lifting or dragging one's pivot foot without dribbling the ball, carrying the ball, or holding the ball with both hands and then resuming dribbling.

In a basketball team, the five players are assigned different positions. The center is usually the tallest player, followed by the power forward who is strong and slightly shorter. The small forward is shorter but more agile, while the shooting guard and point guard are typically the shortest players or the best ball handlers. The shooting guard and point guard are responsible for executing the coach's game plan and managing offensive and defensive plays.

Informally, basketball can also be played in smaller teams, such as three-on-three, two-on-two, or one-on-one.

Basketball was invented in 1891 by James Naismith, a gym teacher from Canada who was living in Springfield, Massachusetts.

#  NBA
The National Basketball Association (NBA) is a professional basketball league consisting of 30 teams, with 29 located in the United States and 1 in Canada. It is widely regarded as the premier professional basketball league in the world and is one of the major professional sports leagues in North America. The league was originally founded as the Basketball Association of America (BAA) in New York City on June 6, 1946, and later changed its name to the National Basketball Association on August 3, 1949, after merging with the National Basketball League (NBL). In 1976, the NBA merged with the American Basketball Association (ABA), adding four franchises to the league. The NBA's regular season runs from October to April, with each team playing 82 games, and the league's playoff tournament extends into June. NBA players are currently the world's highest-paid athletes by average annual salary per player. The NBA is an active member of USA Basketball (USAB), which is recognized by the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) as the national governing body for basketball in the United States. The league's head offices are located in Midtown Manhattan, with several international and individual team offices also directed from there. The NBA Entertainment and NBA TV studios are directed out of offices located in Secaucus, New Jersey. In North America, the NBA is the third wealthiest professional sports league by revenue, after the National Football League (NFL) and Major League Baseball (MLB), and among the top four in the world. The Boston Celtics and the Los Angeles Lakers are tied for the most NBA championships with 17 each, and the current reigning league champions are the Denver Nuggets, who defeated the Miami Heat in the 2023 NBA Finals.
